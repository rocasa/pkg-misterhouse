    debian/TODO for MisterHouse
    ===========================


- System user 'misterhouse' is created at installation time and removed when
  the package is purged. It will be the owner of the /usr/share/misterhouse
  directory, and will run the 'mh' daemon application(s). Are there any groups
  it should be in by default?


- Install the HTML documentation with the misterhouse-doc package, and do that
  so it can be installed by itself (i.e., not dependent on the main misterhouse 
  package being installed).  
    - Correct entry in misterhouse-doc.doc-base for the 'Author:'
    - Correct entry in misterhouse-doc.doc-base for the 'Section:'
    - Rewrite entry in misterhouse-doc.doc-base for 'Abstract:'?
    - Include note about it in main package


- Determine which deamons should be started at run time as well as if there
  should be just one init script or separate ones for things like mh_proxy or
  mh_send_server.pl. (Separate ones could enable those being separately packaged.)

- Add creation of an Arch dependent MisterHouse package.
    - Name misterhouse-xs? Using misterhouse-bin as the name may not be good
      because of the /usr/share/misterhouse/bin directory.
    - Arch dependent packages that are required by MisterHouse?
    - Include Text::LevenshteinXS as a Recommends.
    - Any other XS perl modules?
    - Include a /usr/local/lib/misterhouse directory for locally installed arch
      dependent files installed by local admin?

- Determine just what files need to be installed and where, or even if they need
  to be in even the source package.

    - lib/site contains a large number of perl modules; no need to include them
      in the source or binary package(s) if they're already in Debian or at least
      on CPAN.  (If the latter; add a note for them to README.Debian and then
      investigate getting them into Debian.)

- Specifically review bin/* files for where or if they should be installed.
    - bin/mh.ini - patched version to /etc/misterhouse and as example
    - bin/mh.example.ini - install as example
    - bin/mh_proxy.ini - patched version to /etc/misterhouse and as example
    - 'bin/send_verizon' - for now, install as an example.
    - bin/*rc - Install as examples. (Also contribute new debian example when
      have that working.)
    - Install bin/get_email_rule_example.pl as an example instead of to lib dir?
    - Do not install bin/get_mail.wbt?

- bin/mh:
    - Installed to /usr/share/misterhouse/bin/mh
    - Review commented program lines for if they should be patched to be used. 

- bin/mh.ini:
    - Install it to /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini? To /usr/share/misterhouse/bin/mh.ini?
      Or just a symlink to it in /etc/misterhouse for the latter if it's needed there?
    - Install an unpatched version: with just the misterhouse-doc pkg? Main pkg?
      Will depend in part on how the /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini gets installed.
- /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini
    - Patch:  remove sections regarding viavoice and vv_tts?
    - Patch:  change default from "tk=1" to "tk=0" ?


- Specifically review code/* files for where or if they should be installed.
    - Install code/common/ to /usr/share/misterhouse/common & patch the main
      mh.ini file to set code_dir_common for that?
    - If install the rest of the code/ subdirectories as examples, where to
      point the code_dir parameter to?  A /usr/local/ subdirectory? It looks
      like it is intended to be for the local admin.  

 
- data/ini/*.ini - Install as examples?
- data/ini - Create and reference something like a /etc/misterhouse/ini.d directory?
  And/or just reference all ini files to go to /etc/misterhouse directory?  (Patches
  neccesary to example ini files & etc to reference that?)

  
- Detail Copyright & License as necessary for MisterHouse files for inclusion
  in debian/copyright.


- Determine non-perl package Requires/Recommends/Suggests for debian/control.
    - Should the Recommends for 'mpd' actually be 'mpd|mpd-client'? And should
      it be a Suggests instead?


- Perl Modules Required/Recommended/Suggested for debian/control: review both
  the lib/site/* files as well as the included scripts in the bin/ & code/
  directories (debian/PerlModulesTODO.html)


- Process the distributed *pod files, like 'mh.pod', as man pages as well as to
  html files if they's not already done?


- Configure it for use of a separate '/var/log/misterhouse' directory rather
  than have logs files go to /var/lib/misterhouse/logs?


- Determine a way for MisterHouse to run dwww so that on installs where it's
  the only web server application, the other locally installed documentation
  can be searched and viewed.  Add as note in README.Debian?  (If add a patch
  to always have such a link available, would need to add dwww as a package
  dependency.)
