    debian/TODO for MisterHouse
    ===========================


- System user 'misterhouse' is created at installation time and removed when
  the package is purged. It will be the owner of the /usr/share/misterhouse
  directory, and will run the 'mh' daemon application(s). Are there any groups
  it should be in by default?


- Install the HTML documentation with the misterhouse-doc package, and do that
  so it can be installed by itself (i.e., not dependent on the main misterhouse 
  package being installed).  
    - Correct entry in misterhouse-doc.doc-base for the 'Author:'
    - Rewrite entry in misterhouse-doc.doc-base for 'Abstract:'?
    - Include note about it in main package


- Determine which deamons should be started at run time as well as if there
  should be just one init script or separate ones for things like mh_proxy or
  mh_send_server.pl. (Separate ones could enable those being separately packaged.)

- Add creation of an Arch dependent MisterHouse package.
    - Name misterhouse-xs? Using misterhouse-bin as the name may not be good
      because of the /usr/share/misterhouse/bin directory.
    - Arch dependent packages that are required by MisterHouse?
    - Include Text::LevenshteinXS as a Recommends.
    - Any other XS perl modules?
    - Include a /usr/local/lib/misterhouse directory for locally installed arch
      dependent files installed by local admin?

- Determine just what files need to be installed and where, or even if they need
  to be in even the source package.

    - lib/site contains a large number of perl modules; no need to include them
      in the source or binary package(s) if they're already in Debian or at least
      on CPAN.  (If the latter; add a note for them to README.Debian and then
      investigate getting them into Debian.)

- Specifically review bin/* files for where or if they should be installed.
    - bin/mh.ini - patched version to /etc/misterhouse and as example
    - bin/mh.example.ini - install as example
    - bin/mh_proxy.ini - patched version to /etc/misterhouse and as example
    - 'bin/send_verizon' - for now, install as an example.
    - bin/*rc - Install as examples. (Also contribute new debian example when
      have that working.)
    - Install bin/get_email_rule_example.pl as an example instead of to lib dir?
    - Do not install bin/get_mail.wbt?

- bin/mh:
    - Installed to /usr/share/misterhouse/bin/mh
    - Review commented program lines for if they should be patched to be used. 

- bin/mh.ini:
    - Install it to /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini? To /usr/share/misterhouse/bin/mh.ini?
      Or just a symlink to it in /etc/misterhouse for the latter if it's needed there?
    - Install an unpatched version: with just the misterhouse-doc pkg? Main pkg?
      Will depend in part on how the /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini gets installed.
- /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini
    - Patch:  remove sections regarding viavoice and vv_tts?
    - Patch:  change default from "tk=1" to "tk=0" ?
    - Patch:  default code_dir_common to "/usr/share/misterhouse/common".
    - Patch:  default code_dir to "/usr/local/share/misterhouse/code"?
    - Patch:  default sounds_dir_common to "/usr/share/misterhouse/sounds".
    - Patch:  default sound_dir to "/usr/local/share/misterhouse/sounds"?


- Specifically review code/* files for where or if they should be installed.
    - Install code/common/ to /usr/share/misterhouse/common & patch the main
      mh.ini file to set code_dir_common for that?
    - If install the rest of the code/ subdirectories as examples, where to
      point the code_dir parameter to?  A /usr/local/ subdirectory? It looks
      like it is intended to be for the local admin.  

- sounds/
    - Install as /usr/share/misterhouse/sounds
    - Patch:  set as sound_dir_common in /etc/misterhouse/mh.ini


- data/
    - At least some of the subdirectories should be installed to the main
    /var/lib/misterhouse directory?  But which of the many files actually
    need to be installed except perhaps as examples.?
    - Use just the files named "empty_file" to enable installation of the 
    directories without warnings/errors regarding empty package directories
    from Lintian?

- data/ini/*.ini - Install as examples?

- web/
    - Install required MisterHouse web app files to /usr/share/misterhouse/web?
    - web/my_mh/
        - Install upstream of that in examples?
        - Default a config reference for it to /usr/local/share/misterhouse/web ?
        - Document how that goes in README.Debian
    - Review content for what should better be installed as examples.
        - web/ia#/ directories?
        - Document in README.Debian

  
- Detail Copyright & License as necessary for MisterHouse files for inclusion
  in debian/copyright.
  - Check what license these are; may need to remove and/or not install them
    but update debian/copyright regarding their associated files.
W: misterhouse: extra-license-file usr/share/misterhouse/web/SmoothGallery/license.txt
W: misterhouse: extra-license-file usr/share/misterhouse/web/comics/dailystrips/COPYING

W: misterhouse: extra-license-file usr/share/misterhouse/web/tattler/COPYING


- Determine non-perl package Requires/Recommends/Suggests for debian/control.
    - Should the Recommends for 'mpd' actually be 'mpd|mpd-client'? And should
      it be a Suggests instead?
    - Check for other authors and their licenses and add that as neccessary.
    - Check if there are files or directories which have a different copyright
      and/or license attached and that information added. Also determine if
      any such files actually need to be in the package.


- Perl Modules Required/Recommended/Suggested for debian/control: review both
  the lib/site/* files as well as the included scripts in the bin/ & code/
  directories (debian/PerlModulesTODO.html)


- Process the distributed *pod files, like 'mh.pod', as man pages as well as to
  html files if that's not already done?

- The 'bottlerocket' package is a Suggested install. Add docs regarding it to
  the README.Debian file.

- docs/toc.html
    - Discussion in the mailing list (20 Mar 13) about several links to web
    counters in docs/toc.html (lines 29-35). A concensus was reached about
    removing them altogether (possibly to be replaced by an opt in under mh
    project control but that needs to be researched), although a bug has not
    been opened for it. Add a patch for at least v2.200 that removes the
    links and reference at least the mailing list dicussion.

- Configure it for use of a separate '/var/log/misterhouse' directory rather
  than have logs files go to /var/lib/misterhouse/logs?


- Determine a way for MisterHouse to run dwww so that on installs where it's
  the only web server application, the other locally installed documentation
  can be searched and viewed.  Add a note in README.Debian?  (If add a patch
  to always have such a link available, would need to add dwww as a package
  dependency.)  Use something like "html_alias_dwww = /var/www/dwww" plus 
  a link somewhere?  



    - Lintian results from a test build on 20 March 2013


    - Change how the contents of doc/examples/examples gets installed?
E: misterhouse-doc: nested-examples-directory usr/share/doc/misterhouse-doc/examples/examples/


    - Need to fix the installation and/or doc-base path reference.
E: misterhouse-doc: doc-base-file-references-missing-file misterhouse:9 /usr/share/doc/misterhouse-doc/html/index.html
E: misterhouse-doc: doc-base-file-references-missing-file misterhouse:10 /usr/share/doc/misterhouse-doc/html/*.html


    - These don't even need to be in the orig archive? Just don't install? Does
    any of the web/iphone/WebApp files need be installed as anything but examples?
W: misterhouse: windows-thumbnail-database-in-package usr/share/misterhouse/web/iphone/WebApp/Design/Img/Thumbs.db

    - Provided by libjs-jquery package. Replace with package dependency plus
      sym link? Just remove plus document in README.Debian?
W: misterhouse: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/misterhouse/web/iphone/jquery/jquery.min.js
W: misterhouse: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/misterhouse/web/js/jquery.min.js

    - Provided by libjs-mootools package. Replace with package dependency plus
      sym link? Just remove plus document in README.Debian?
W: misterhouse: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/misterhouse/web/SmoothGallery/scripts/mootools.v1.11.js
W: misterhouse: embedded-javascript-library usr/share/misterhouse/web/slideshow/js/mootools.js

    - This is intended to be part of the documentation and therefore will not be
      executed there. Override? It appears to be available as the (newer) package
      libjs-prototype; replace with an info file noting that? Just remove plus
      document in README.Debian? (And might that pkg info be pushed upstream?)
