pkg-misterhouse
===============

Debian packaging for the MisterHouse Perl open source home automation program

* The eventual goal of this project is to get a MisterHouse source package into Debian, for which there has already been an [ITP](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=586135) bug open for doing so. And in the meantime, is still intended to be useful.
* Due to [DFSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines) issues that are still to be resolved (for some details, see the debian/TODO document), initially only the debian/ directory itself will be kept in the repository, until such time that a DFSG free *.orig.tar.gz file can be finalized.
* Upstream Development Repository - [GitHub hollie/misterhouse](https://github.com/hollie/misterhouse)
